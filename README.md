# The E3SM Data State Machine

The E3SM Data State Machine (`datasm`) is a library that automates complex nested workflows for handling E3SM outputs. These workflows use conditional branching based on the success or failure of the jobs within them. Workflow jobs include `extract`, `validate`, `postprocess`, and `publish`.

- **_Note: `datasm` is currently in active development, so many planned features may be a work in progress, missing, or broken._**
