# ESGF Publisher and E3SM Automated Warehouse

This repository contains two modules:
1. The ESGF Publisher, which are scripts to publish data to ESGF.
2. The E3SM Automated Warehouse, which is a utility that allows for the automation of complex nested workflows with conditional branching based on the success or failure of the jobs.
