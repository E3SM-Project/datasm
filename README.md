# The E3SM Automated Warehouse

The E3SM Automated Warehouse (`warehouse`) library automates complex nested workflows for handling E3SM outputs. These workflows use conditional branching based on the success or failure of the jobs within the workflows. The jobs include `extract`, `validate`, `postprocess`, and `publish`.

- **_Note: The warehouse is currently in active development, so many planned features may be a work in progress, missing, or broken._**
