UPON RELOCATION:

    For a full Re-Install of the Publication System, first 3 Steps to take:

    1.  Select a fixed user-readble/executable <location> for placing
        .dsm_get_root_path.sh
        .dsm_root_paths

    2.  Edit the script "dsm_get_root_path.sh" to give it the
        selected <location>.

    3.  Have each user add the following line to their .bashrc file:
        export DSM_GETPATH=<location>/.dsm_get_root_path.sh

The file of root-paths, 
    /p/user_pub/e3sm/staging/.dsm_root_paths

contains

    # root_tag:root_path
    ARCHIVE_STORAGE:/p/user_pub/e3sm/archive
    ARCHIVE_MANAGEMENT:/p/user_pub/e3sm/staging/resource/archive
    DSM_STAGING:/p/user_pub/e3sm/staging
    STAGING_DATA:/p/user_pub/e3sm/warehouse
    STAGING_RESOURCE:/p/user_pub/e3sm/staging/resource
    STAGING_STATUS:/p/user_pub/e3sm/staging/status
    STAGING_TOOLS:/p/user_pub/e3sm/staging/tools
    PUBLICATION_DATA:/p/user_pub/work
    USER_ROOT:/p/user_pub/e3sm


USAGE in BASH

    apath=`$DSM_GETPATH <root_tag>`

    (example)
    warehouse_root=`$DSM_GETPATH STAGING_DATA`

USAGE in PYTHON

    import datasm.util

    dsm_paths = get_dsm_paths()
    warehouse_root = dsm_paths["STAGING_DATA"]
    archive_root = dsm_paths["ARCHIVE_STORAGE"]
    ... etc - whatever root paths are needed

# NOTE:  For User Ops_work, these directories give a good way to isolate operational activities, sequester logfiles generated, etc.
