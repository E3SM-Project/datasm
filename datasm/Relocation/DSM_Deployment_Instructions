DSM_Deployment_Instructions
===========================

NOTE:  To help avoid access control issues, it is best to create a group
account (e.g. "publishers") and be a member of such during deployment, and
for all subsequent "publication-related" operations.

1. Unpacking
============

In any suitable location (may be temp or scratch) open the received DSM_RELOC
package (DSM_RELOC.tar.gz) with:

    gunzip DSM_RELOC.tar.gz
    tar xvf DSM_RELOC.tar

A single directory "RELOC" will appear, containing these deployment
instructions and 9 subdirectories.

    -rw-rw-r--.  1_DSM_Deployment_Instructions
    drwxrwxr-x.  ARCHIVE_MANAGEMENT
    drwxrwxr-x.  ARCHIVE_STORAGE
    drwxrwxr-x.  DSM_STAGING
    drwxrwxr-x.  PUBLICATION_DATA
    drwxrwxr-x.  STAGING_DATA
    drwxrwxr-x.  STAGING_RESOURCE
    drwxrwxr-x.  STAGING_STATUS
    drwxrwxr-x.  STAGING_TOOLS
    drwxrwxr-x.  USER_ROOT

The contents of the subdirectories will be moved to suitable filesystem
locations by the deployment process.  Your selection of locations should
be group readable/writeable/executable (rwx) to all members of the group
(e.g. "publishers") who will be conducting publication operations.

The directories ARCHIVE_STORAGE, PUBLICATION_DATA, and STAGING_DATA are
supplied empty, but included as locations that must be defined.

2. Setup Relocatable Paths
==========================

In the RELOC/DSM_STAGING/ directory, you will find two "hidden" files:

    .dsm_root_paths
    .dsm_get_root_path.sh

The file ".dsm_root_paths" defines the location of common operational
tools and other system components.  You must edit the .dsm_root_paths file
to enable both the system deployment, and to allow all deployed tools to
locate their subordinate scripts and related system configs.

The chosen locations must be read/write/executable for all users who
will be conducting publication operations (e.g. group = "publishers").

The value for "USER_ROOT" should be the full root path to individual
user account directories.  These can be "home" directories or any other
user-specific (scratch/workspace) account directories.  (Ideally, these
should be co-located on the filesystem with the locations where most
data operations will be conducted, minimizing network load). At runtime,
the value of "whoami" will be appended to this directory in order to locate
the user-specific operational directories.

You will then be ready to execute the "Relocation_Deployment.sh" script.

Upon execution of the "Relocation_Deployment.sh" script, all content found
below the RELOC/<RootTag>/ directories will be moved to their indicated
destinations.  As well, the ".dsm_root_paths" and ".dsm_get_root_path.sh"
will be moved to the DSM_STAGING location, and the script automatically
edited to embed the new location of the root_paths file.

Finally, each user/operator will need to add the following EXPORT to their
personal ".bashrc" file:

    export DSM_GETPATH=<full_path_to_chosen_DMS_STAGING>/.dsm_get_root_path.sh

As installer, you will be prompted with the fully-qualified export upon
the completion of deployment.

Each user will need to "source" their .bashrc file, or open a new console
terminal shell to enable the export.

3. DSM System Deployment
========================

The deployment script "Relocation_Deployment.sh" should be executed in the
directory where the un-tarred "RELOC/" appearsi below.  Otherwise, you will
need to supply the full-path to this RELOC directory as a parameter:

    ./Relocation_Deployment.sh [<full_path_to_RELOC>]

Deployment should take under a minute.  You will be prompted upon completion.
