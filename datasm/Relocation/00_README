This directory is the home of the DataSM (DSM) Relocation System.

It holds:

1.  The "hidden" .dsm_root_paths file and .dsm_get_root_paths.sh script
    that enables all DSM system tools to find one another, configs, etc.

2.  The tools specific to defining, collecting, migrating and deploying
    the DSM System to other sites.

The DSM Operator(s) must maintain the DataSM_System_Local_Manifest_Spec
which details all elements of the system that support common operations.
