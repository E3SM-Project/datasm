This directory is the home of the DataSM (DSM) Relocation System.

It holds:

1.  The "hidden" .dsm_root_paths file and .dsm_get_root_paths.sh script
    that enables all DSM system tools to find one another, configs, etc.

2.  The tools specific to defining, collecting, migrating and deploying
    the DSM System to other sites.

The DSM Operator(s) must maintain the DataSM_System_Local_Manifest_Spec
which details all elements of the system that support common operations.

Unlike elements of the DataSM application proper, which are installed as
part of a given conda operational environment (thus, the modules remain
within the cloned git repository and are detectible as having changed),
many extended elements of the DSM system (common resources such as the
dataset_spec.yaml and scored of commonly employed scripting tools, as
well as the user/operator's local work area scripts) are scattered well
beyond the git repository, and must be tracked and accounted for so that
they may be routinely collected to the DataSM repository, and moreover
identified as to their deployment locations for operational use.

The DataSM_System_Local_Manifest_Spec serves to concisely identify these
disparate elements of the DataSM System.  It can be expanded to a full
manifest with

    Manifest_Generate.sh

and all content collected to a flat directory for tar-file migration by

    Relocation_Collection.sh

Independently, the deployed elements can be copied to the DataSM repo by

    Gitstore_Common_Elements.sh
    Gitstore_UserOp_Elements.sh
